* Setting up the Julia Project and A Jupyter Kernel

These insstructions assume you have installed a recent version of
Julia via whatever package manager or means suitable for your
platform. See: [[www.julialang.org]] for how this might go.

Also you will have already installed at least /jupyter-kernel/ package via
whatever python means and that the /jupyter/ command is available.

We assume a unix-like shell environment for the command line.  

** Basic setup

0. Checkout this project into a suitable directory using /git/
   #+begin_src
   git clone https://github.com/sebeaumont/GDL2eFlux.git
   #+end_src
   
1. Start Julia with that directory as the project:
   #+begin_src
   julia --project=GDL2eFlux
   #+end_src

2. At the julia prompt type ] to get into the package manager
   #+begin_src julia
   instantiate # will install all the package dependencies including IJulia
   #+end_src
   backspace to get back to the julia prompt and create a julia kernel
   using [[https://julialang.github.io/IJulia.jl/stable/][IJulia package]].
   #+begin_src julia
   using IJulia
   installkernel("{great-name-for-kernel}[gdl2eflux]", "--project={absolute-path to the directory[GDL2eFlux]}")
   #+end_src
   There's a bunch of other stuff you can do to the Julia kernel setup
   so it's worth RTM for IJulia if you want to do this kind of thing
   for work. Exit julia.

3. Back at the command prompt:
   #+begin_src
   jupyter kernelspec list
   #+end_src
   Should list all the kernels including the one you just created. We
   are good to go...

** Now the world is your oyster

So there are a number of possibilites now depending on your persuation
from a development tooling point of view. Personally I am a die hard
/emacs/ jock of forty years - I've been impressed with /VSCode/ but
that now looks like typical /M$/ sponsored bloatware, as indeed is the
/LSP/.

If you do decide that /emacs/ is the way, then as far as literate
programming, /org-mode/ and /jupyter-emacs/ will be the guiding
light on the path to Nirvana. Also /julia-snail/ is good for
developing julia in the raw.

I'm sure there are other routes less travelled but that's enough
doctrine for now.

The files in the /org/ directory are the masters for this
project. Straight Julia source modules will be tangled from them where
reuse makes sense: /src/

I might provide /pluto.jl/ notebooks if someone pays me. Or I might
figure out an easy way to tangle them from the org files.

As a source format for code, notebooks are a misfeature resulting from
/Mathematica/ envy. Form and function should be cleanly separated. Of
course scientific programmers never knew this.

The best option we have in 2013 for literate programming is /org/ it just
takes a bit more effort.
