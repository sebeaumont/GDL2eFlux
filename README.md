# GDL2eFlux
Following examples from [David Foster's Generative Deep Learning (2nd. Edition)](https://github.com/davidADSP/Generative_Deep_Learning_2nd_Edition) 

Julia-Flux version 

Which means I get to learn Julia and Flux as well as how these models
perform. This will help me choose tooling for an upcoming project.

I'll be using Flux and since I run mainly on Mac OS: Metal GPU
accelerators. I'm looking to develop and benchmark online training of
a generative model for a proprietary application, however this project
allows me to share some work and results back into the community.

All errors, omissions and bogisities are my own work. I'm interested
in application and practical considerations of scale and ergonomics as
well as how well the and code/model can be integrated.

Some examples may need to be adapted for the frameworks concerened
from the original Tensorflow/Keras in the book cited. I reserve the
right to depart from that script and explore avenues more relevant to
my misison.

I will be repeating this exercise in Jax/Flax (Python) so we will have
GDL2E cooked three ways and hopefully a better understanding of the
merits of each framework and language. 

I'll be developing the prototype application as I go in Julia as I
know Python and I'd like to give Julia a try. 

I won't be using the ubiquitous Jupyter notebook format. All my
stuff will be in org files using jupyter-emacs for the backends. 
This means I can mix kernels (languages and environments) willy nilly
and write notes so that source code can be tangled and documents
extracted. YMMV.
